- Better to master one course thoroughly than rush through all 4
- Code along with every example
- Build projects after each module

**Tip 2: Use Google Colab for Free GPU**
- Free tier includes T4 GPU
- Perfect for learning and small experiments
- Upgrade to Colab Pro ($10/month) for better GPU

**Tip 3: Start with Small Datasets**
- Don't try to fine-tune on 100K examples at first
- Start with 500-1000 examples
- Iterate and improve

**Tip 4: Document Everything**
- Keep notes on what works/doesn't work
- Track training metrics
- Build knowledge base for team

**Tip 5: Focus on ONE Product First**
- Don't try to fine-tune models for all 3 products at once
- Start with Hey You're Hired (resume analyzer)
- Perfect it, then move to next product
